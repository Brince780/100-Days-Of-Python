#Section3: Day3 - Beginer - Control Flow And Logical Operations

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

    Equals: a == b
    Not Equals: a != b
    Less than: a < b
    Less than or equal to: a <= b
    Greater than: a > b
    Greater than or equal to: a >= b

The if-else statement is used to execute both the true part and the false part of a given condition.
If the condition is true, the if block code is executed and if the condition is false,
the else block code is executed.

if condition:
    do this
else:
    do this
