Section4: Day4 - Beginner - Randomisation and Python Lists

Python Random Module -> import random
Python has a built-in module that you can use to make random numbers.

The random module has a set of methods:
Method 	Description
seed() 	Initialize the random number generator
getstate() 	Returns the current internal state of the random number generator
setstate() 	Restores the internal state of the random number generator
getrandbits() 	Returns a number representing the random bits
randrange() 	Returns a random number between the given range
randint() 	Returns a random number between the given range
choice() 	Returns a random element from the given sequence
choices() 	Returns a list with a random selection from the given sequence
shuffle() 	Takes a sequence and returns the sequence in a random order
sample() 	Returns a given sample of a sequence
random() 	Returns a random float number between 0 and 1
uniform() 	Returns a random float number between two given parameters
triangular() 	Returns a random float number between two given parameters, you can also set a mode parameter to specify the midpoint between the two other parameters
betavariate() 	Returns a random float number between 0 and 1 based on the Beta distribution (used in statistics)
expovariate() 	Returns a random float number based on the Exponential distribution (used in statistics)
gammavariate() 	Returns a random float number based on the Gamma distribution (used in statistics)
gauss() 	Returns a random float number based on the Gaussian distribution (used in probability theories)
lognormvariate() 	Returns a random float number based on a log-normal distribution (used in probability theories)
normalvariate() 	Returns a random float number based on the normal distribution (used in probability theories)
vonmisesvariate() 	Returns a random float number based on the von Mises distribution (used in directional statistics)
paretovariate() 	Returns a random float number based on the Pareto distribution (used in probability theories)
weibullvariate() 	Returns a random float number based on the Weibull distribution (used in statistics)

Python Lists
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
    List Items
        List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
        List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
    Ordered
        When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order,
        and that order will not change.
        If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
    Changeable
        The list is changeable, meaning that we can change,
        add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
